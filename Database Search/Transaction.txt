In databases (especially SQL), a Transaction is a sequence of one or more operations that are treated as one single unit of work.

Why transactions matter

They protect your data from:

Partial updates

System crashes

Logical errors

Example: transferring money — you must debit one account and credit another together.

ACID Properties (Very Important ⭐)

A transaction follows ACID:

Atomicity – All or nothing

Consistency – Database remains valid

Isolation – Transactions don’t interfere

Durability – Changes stay after commit

Basic SQL Transaction Commands

START TRANSACTION;   -- or BEGIN

INSERT INTO Orders VALUES (1, 'Laptop', 2);
UPDATE Products SET Stock = Stock - 2 WHERE ProductID = 5;

COMMIT;   


If something goes wrong:

ROLLBACK; -- undo all changes


Example (Bank Transfer)

START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Accounts
SET Balance = Balance - 500
WHERE AccountID = 1;

UPDATE Accounts
SET Balance = Balance + 500
WHERE AccountID = 2;

COMMIT;


When to use transactions

Use them when:

Multiple related INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE

Financial operations

Inventory updates

Booking / enrollment systems
