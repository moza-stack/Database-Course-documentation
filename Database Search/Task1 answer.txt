Schema changes may be difficult in highly dynamic environments.
| **Aspect**          | **Flat File Systems**                                                                        | **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**                                                        |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structure**       | Data stored in plain text, CSV, or simple files; no enforced schema; one table per file      | Data stored in structured tables with rows/columns; schema enforced through constraints |
| **Data Redundancy** | High redundancy; repeated data across files                                                  | Low redundancy due to normalization and constraint enforcement                          |
| **Relationships**   | No built-in support; relationships handled manually                                          | Supports primary/foreign keys, joins, and multiple relationship types                   |
| **Example Usage**   | Small datasets, logs, configs, simple applications, CSV/JSON files                           | Enterprise systems, banking, hospitals, ERPs, multi-user applications                   |
| **Drawbacks**       | Poor scalability, no integrity rules, difficult relationship management, inefficient queries | Requires setup and maintenance, resource-heavy, needs database administration knowledge |
