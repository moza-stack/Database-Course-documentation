Types of Databases 

Relational vs Non-Relational Databases
What they are

Relational databases store data in structured tables (rows & columns), with a predefined schema. Tables are related via keys (primary / foreign), enabling relationships between data entities. Data is accessed via SQL (Structured Query Language).

Non-relational databases (often called NoSQL) do not rely on fixed tables/rows. Instead they store data in flexible structures — e.g. documents (JSON/BSON), key-value pairs, wide-columns, graphs, etc
| Feature                    | Relational                                                                                               | Non-Relational (NoSQL)                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Schema / Data structure    | Fixed schema, structured tables. ([C# Corner][1])                                                        | Dynamic / schema-less; supports documents, key-value, column-family, graph, etc. ([stackby.com][2])                              |
| Queries & Relationships    | Powerful SQL queries, joins across tables — great for relational data. ([insightsoftware][3])            | Often simpler / specialized query mechanisms; relationships possible but less central. ([Secoda][4])                             |
| Transactions & Consistency | Typically supports full ACID transactions, ensuring strong consistency. ([insightsoftware][3])           | Many trade strict consistency for flexibility/performance — eventual consistency or tunable consistency. ([stackby.com][2])      |
| Scalability                | Usually scales vertically (bigger server), which may limit scaling at very large loads. ([AppMaster][5]) | Designed for horizontal scaling (across many servers/nodes), handling large or growing data volumes well. ([insightsoftware][3]) |
| Flexibility                | Less flexible: schema changes can be disruptive. ([AlmaBetter][6])                                       | Highly flexible: can evolve data model quickly, handle varying/unstructured data. ([Castor Doc][7])                              |

Examples

Relational: common RDBMS such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.

When to use which (Use-cases)

Relational DB

Use when data is highly structured and relationships matter (e.g. foreign-key relationships). For example: financial systems, banking, accounting, enterprise resource planning (ERP), CRM — where consistency and transactions are critical. 
insightsoftware
+1

When you need complex queries, joins, reporting, data integrity, ACID transactions.

Non-Relational (NoSQL) DB

Use when data is unstructured or semi-structured (e.g. JSON documents, user-generated content, logs). 
Global Tech Council
+1

When you need scalability and performance horizontally (e.g. big-data, high-throughput writes/reads). 
Oracle

Examples

Using MongoDB for a social-media backend where each user’s profile and activity log may differ (flexible schema), or for storing logs/events.

Using Cassandra for a high-volume telemetry or IoT platform, where many events/data points are collected and queried quickly across many machines.

🌐 Centralized vs Distributed vs Cloud (Distributed-Cloud) Databases
Definitions & Architecture

Centralized database — All data resides in a single database instance, hosted at one location (server, mainframe, data center) and managed centrally. 
Wikipedia
+1

Distributed database — Data is spread across multiple servers (nodes), potentially across different physical/geographic locations. The distributed system works as a single logical database for the application. 
Oracle
+2
Educative
+2

Cloud (or Cloud-backed) databases / Cloud-distributed databases — A variant of distributed databases that leverage cloud infrastructure: data is stored across cloud servers/data-centers, possibly distributed globally, with managed scalability, replication, and high availability. (Often the “distributed database in the cloud” model.)

Key trade-offs

Centralized: simpler to manage, consistent data (single point of truth), easier to maintain integrity and integrity constraints. But has a single point of failure; limited scalability; may become bottleneck. 
Wikipedia
+1

Distributed: offers horizontal scalability, high availability (if one node fails others can take over), and can serve globally distributed users with lower latency (by placing nodes closer to users) 
Oracle
+1
. However, complexity rises: data synchronization, consistency across nodes, replication overhead, potential latency. 
Oracle
+1

Cloud / Cloud-distributed: inherits advantages of distributed (scalability, resilience) and adds on-demand resource provisioning, global reach, managed infrastructure — reducing the burden of hardware management. Also supports dynamic scaling as usage grows or shrinks.

Use-case Examples

Centralized: small-to-medium organizations, legacy applications, internal systems where traffic and data volume are modest; e.g. a small company’s HR system, a local university’s student database, a small business’s inventory tracking on a single server.

Distributed / Cloud-distributed: large-scale web apps, global applications, high-availability services, big-data platforms. For example: a global e-commerce site with users across continents; a SaaS platform serving users in multiple regions; real-time analytics or logging systems; distributed microservices architectures; global content-delivery systems.

Hybrid cloud / distributed-cloud: companies wanting to scale out as demand grows, while avoiding on-prem hardware overhead. Many modern apps use cloud databases to get scalability + flexibility + resilience.

In particular, distributed databases are often used as the “backend” for applications that need to handle high throughput, real-time data, or globally distributed user bases.




Cloud Storage and Databases

Cloud Storage

Cloud storage is a service where data is stored on remote servers accessed via the internet, rather than on local physical devices. These servers are hosted and managed by cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Key Features

Accessible from anywhere through the internet

Highly scalable (storage grows as needed)

Managed security, backups, and maintenance

Pay-as-you-go pricing

Examples

AWS S3

Azure Blob Storage

Google Cloud Storage

Relation Between Cloud Storage and Databases

Cloud storage and cloud databases are related but not the same:

Cloud Storage

Stores files, documents, images, videos, backups, logs, etc.

Not structured like a database.

Cloud Databases

Full database systems hosted in the cloud.

Store structured or semi-structured data.

Support SQL queries, transactions, indexing, etc.

How they relate

Cloud storage can be used to hold backups of cloud databases.

Databases may use cloud storage internally for scaling or durability (e.g., Google Spanner, Snowflake).

Applications often use both:

Cloud Storage for large files

Cloud Database for transactional data

Advantages & Disadvantages of Cloud-Based Databases

Examples include Azure SQL, Amazon RDS, Google Cloud Spanner, MongoDB Atlas, etc.

Advantages
1. Scalability

Automatically adjusts resources (CPU, memory, storage)

Easy to scale up or out based on demand

2. High Availability

Built-in redundancy across regions or zones

Automatic failover

Minimal downtime

3. Managed Maintenance

Cloud providers handle:

Backups

Patching

Updates

Monitoring

This reduces the workload on DBAs.

4. Cost Efficiency

Pay only for what you use

No need to purchase physical servers

Reduces IT overhead

5. Security

Data encryption at rest & in transit

Access control & auditing

Compliance certifications (ISO, GDPR, HIPAA support depending on provider)

6. Global Access

Applications can connect from anywhere

Databases can replicate across regions for low latency

Disadvantages
1. Internet Dependency

Requires a stable internet connection

Latency may affect performance for real-time systems

2. Ongoing Monthly Costs

Costs can increase with:

High storage

High traffic

Cross-region replication

High compute power

3. Limited Control

Users cannot access the physical servers

Some features may not be customizable

Performance tuning is restricted compared to self-hosted databases

4. Vendor Lock-In

Moving from AWS → Azure → GCP can be difficult

Migration can require rewriting parts of the application

5. Security Risks

Although cloud is secure, it introduces:

Risk of misconfiguration (e.g., public access)

Shared responsibility model

Potential exposure if credentials are leaked

6. Compliance Challenges

Some industries have strict rules:

Healthcare

Finance

Government
May require special configurations or on-premise components.
