NULL:

In SQL, SET NULL is usually associated with foreign key constraints and ON DELETE/ON UPDATE actions. It defines what should happen to a foreign key in a child table when the corresponding row in the parent table is deleted or updated.


Explanation:

ON DELETE SET NULL: If a row in Parent is deleted, the ParentID in Child will be set to NULL.

ON UPDATE SET NULL: If the primary key of Parent is updated, the ParentID in Child will be set to NULL.

Important: The column in the child table (ParentID here) must allow NULLs. Otherwise, you’ll get an error.


DEFAULT:

In SQL, the DEFAULT keyword is used when you want a column to automatically have a specific value if no value is provided during an INSERT. This is useful for things like status flags, timestamps, or numeric counters.

DEFAULT only applies when no value is given in the INSERT.

It works with numbers, strings, dates, and even expressions like CURRENT_DATE.

Not all SQL databases have exactly the same syntax. For example, MySQL uses ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY column_name datatype DEFAULT default_value;.


NO ACTION:

In SQL, NO ACTION is a referential action you can specify when defining foreign keys. It controls what happens when a referenced row in the parent table is updated or deleted.



CASCADE
In SQL, CASCADE is a keyword used in the context of foreign keys and constraints to automatically propagate changes from a parent table to a child table. It helps maintain referential integrity without manually updating or deleting related records.
